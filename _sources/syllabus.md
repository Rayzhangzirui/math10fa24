**About ChatGPT**: ChatGPT (or other AI Language Model) is a valuable resource for programming help. Please use it wisely: (1) Relying too heavily on ChatGPT might hinder your learning. The exams are closed computers. (2) Code from ChatGPT might be incorrect. Remember to thoroughly review and understand the generated code.
